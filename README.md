# VB_AR_Fit
A variational Bayesian method for estimating the parameters of an autoregressive time series model.

This is an implementation of the following paper:

Penny, W. D., & Roberts, S. J. (2000). Bayesian methods for autoregressive models. In Neural Networks for Signal Processing X, 2000. Proceedings of the 2000 IEEE Signal Processing Society Workshop (Vol. 1, pp. 125-134). IEEE.

I take no credit for the development of this algorithm whatsoever.

Included Jupyter notebooks analyze AR parameter estimate bias, algorithm convergence, and model order selection accuracy.
